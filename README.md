## Getting Started

### Prerequisite

Before setting up the environment, navigate to the project folder where `main.py` and `requirements.txt` are located:

```bash
cd a2_starter_code/a2_group11
```

Then, install the dependencies by creating and activating a virtual environment.

> **Windows: Use Command Prompt (cmd.exe)**
>
> Open **Command Prompt** in this folder and run:
> ```cmd
> python -m venv venv
> venv\Scripts\activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```

> **macOS/Linux**
> ```bash
> python3 -m venv venv
> source venv/bin/activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```

---

## Running the Project

Make sure you are in the application folder and the virtual environment is active before starting the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Notes

- Always ensure you are inside `a2_starter_code/a2_group11` before creating or activating the virtual environment.
- Creating the virtual environment outside this folder may cause missing dependency issues.
- If you encounter dependency issues, upgrade pip:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
